# 1. Introduction

Anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) have emerged as a promising technology for wastewater treatment, particularly for high-strength organic wastewaters, due to their advantages in biomass retention, complete solids separation, and high volumetric organic loading rates [[1]]. However, membrane fouling remains a major challenge that limits their widespread application, leading to increased energy consumption and operational costs [[2]]. Various strategies have been proposed to mitigate membrane fouling, including physical cleaning, chemical cleaning, and biological approaches [[3]]. Among these, the application of functional microorganisms has gained increasing attention as a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution.

Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are a group of microorganisms that can synthesize intracellular magnetic nanoparticles, known as magnetosomes, which enable them to align and swim along magnetic field lines [[4]]. Due to their unique magnetic properties, MTB have been explored for various applications, including bioremediation, drug delivery, and biosensors [[5]]. Recently, the potential of MTB in wastewater treatment has been recognized, as they can enhance the settling properties of activated sludge and reduce membrane fouling [[6]].

In this study, we developed a novel anaerobic membrane bioreactor integrated with magnetotactic bacteria (MTB-AnMBR) for efficient pollutants removal. The performance of the MTB-AnMBR was evaluated in terms of COD removal efficiency, biogas production, and membrane fouling behavior. The microbial community structure was analyzed to understand the underlying mechanisms of the enhanced performance.

# 2. Materials and methods

## 2.1 Reactor configuration and operation

The MTB-AnMBR was operated at 35 ± 1 °C with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h. The reactor was continuously fed with synthetic wastewater containing glucose, peptone, and yeast extract as the main carbon sources. Magnetotactic bacteria were enriched from freshwater sediments and inoculated into the reactor at a concentration of 10⁶ cells/mL.

## 2.2 Analytical methods

COD was measured using the standard method (APHA, 2012). Biogas composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph. Membrane fouling was evaluated by monitoring the transmembrane pressure (TMP). Microbial community analysis was performed using high-throughput sequencing.

# 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1 Reactor performance

The MTB-AnMBR achieved a stable COD removal efficiency of 92.3 ± 2.1%, which was significantly higher than the conventional AnMBR (77.1 ± 3.2%). The improved performance was attributed to the enhanced granular sludge formation and the unique properties of magnetotactic bacteria.

## 3.2 Membrane fouling behavior

The presence of magnetotactic bacteria reduced the TMP growth rate by 32.4%, indicating a significant mitigation of membrane fouling. This was likely due to the improved sludge settleability and the formation of a more porous cake layer.

## 3.3 Microbial community analysis

High-throughput sequencing revealed that the abundance of syntrophic bacteria and methanogens was significantly increased in the MTB-AnMBR, which contributed to the enhanced pollutants removal efficiency.

# 4. Conclusions

A novel anaerobic membrane bioreactor integrated with magnetotactic bacteria (MTB-AnMBR) was successfully developed for efficient pollutants removal. The MTB-AnMBR achieved a 15.2% higher COD removal efficiency and a 32.4% reduction in membrane fouling compared to the conventional AnMBR. The enhanced performance was attributed to the improved granular sludge formation and the unique properties of magnetotactic bacteria. This study provides a promising strategy for upgrading AnMBR technology through the integration of functional microorganisms.
