  -p, --path PATH                 local filepath or directory. support pdf,
                                  png, jpg, jpeg files  [required]
  -o, --output PATH               output local directory  [required]
  -m, --method [auto|txt|ocr]     the method for parsing pdf:
                                    auto: Automatically determine the method based on the file type.
                                    txt: Use text extraction method.
                                    ocr: Use OCR method for image-based PDFs.
                                  Without method specified, 'auto' will be used by default.
                                  Adapted only for the case where the backend is set to 'pipeline'.
  -b, --backend [pipeline|vlm-transformers|vlm-vllm-engine|vlm-http-client]
                                  the backend for parsing pdf:
                                    pipeline: More general.
                                    vlm-transformers: More general, but slower.
                                    vlm-mlx-engine: Faster than transformers.
                                    vlm-vllm-engine: Faster(engine).
                                    vlm-http-client: Faster(client).
                                  Without method specified, pipeline will be used by default.
  -l, --lang [ch|ch_server|ch_lite|en|korean|japan|chinese_cht|ta|te|ka|th|el|latin|arabic|east_slavic|cyrillic|devanagari]
                                  Input the languages in the pdf (if known) to
                                  improve OCR accuracy. Without languages
                                  specified, 'ch' will be used by default.
                                  Adapted only for the case where the backend
                                  is set to "pipeline".
  -u, --url TEXT                  When the backend is `vlm-http-client`, you
                                  need to specify the server_url, for
                                  example:`http://127.0.0.1:30000`
  -s, --start INTEGER             The starting page for PDF parsing, beginning
                                  from 0.
  -e, --end INTEGER               The ending page for PDF parsing, beginning
                                  from 0.
  -f, --formula BOOLEAN           Enable formula parsing. Default is True.
                                  Adapted only for the case where the backend
                                  is set to "pipeline".
  -t, --table BOOLEAN             Enable table parsing. Default is True.
                                  Adapted only for the case where the backend
                                  is set to "pipeline".
  -d, --device TEXT               Device mode for model inference, e.g.,
                                  "cpu", "cuda", "cuda:0", "npu", "npu:0",
                                  "mps". Adapted only for the case where the
                                  backend is set to "pipeline" and "vlm-
                                  transformers".
  --vram INTEGER                  Upper limit of GPU memory occupied by a
                                  single process. Adapted only for the case
                                  where the backend is set to "pipeline".
  --source [huggingface|modelscope|local]
                                  The source of the model repository. Default
                                  is 'huggingface'.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
