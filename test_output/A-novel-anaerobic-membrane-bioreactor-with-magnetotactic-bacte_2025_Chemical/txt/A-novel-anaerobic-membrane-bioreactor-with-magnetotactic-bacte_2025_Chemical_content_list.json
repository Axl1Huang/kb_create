The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) with excellent adsorption capabilities on the performance of the AnMBR system at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The MTB-assisted AnMBR (R2) showed improved COD removal efficiency (75 %-78 %) over c-AnMBR (R1) by 3 %-7% at HRT of 60, 48, and 36 h. Mancozeb and ethylenethiourea removal efficiencies of R2 were 7.1 %-25.0 % and 25.2 %-28.5 % higher than R1, respectively. The Mn2+ and Zn2+ of R2 were significantly reduced by 16.8 ± 1.9 % and 10.0 ± 0.8 % than that of R1, which were obtained at HRT of 36 h. The activity ratio of protease and dehydrogenase between R1 and R2 was 205.5 % and 419.6 %, respectively. Specific methane yield and specific methane activity of R2 were 1.16 and 1.13 times those of R1, respectively. A mathematical model correlating refractory pollutants, enzyme activity, and COD removal efficiency was established. This study innovatively developed a green MTB-assisted AnMBR technology that successfully removed refractory pollutants and heavy metals while enhancing enzyme activity and methane yield, reducing toxicity threat and improving energy recovery efficiency, along with providing both scientific basis and technical foundation for low-carbon operation of pesticide wastewater treatment.

        "text": "Pesticides are widely applied to eliminate or control diseases, insects, weeds and other hazardous organisms, which harm agriculture and forestry. According to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, the national production of chemical pesticide prodrugs (100 % active ingredient) was 3.723 Mt in 2023, with an increase of 49.1 % from 2022 [1]. Pesticides can be divided into organic sulfur pesticides, organophosphorus pesticides, pyrethroids pesticides, sulfonylurea pesticides and biological pesticides, etc. Among them, organic sulfur pesticides mainly include ethylenebisdithiocarbamate fungicides, nereistoxin insecticides, thiram fungicides, and so on. Pesticide wastewater is generated during the production of organic sulfur pesticides. This wastewater contains refractory parent compounds such as mancozeb and ethylenethiourea (ETU), which are difficult to be degraded. In addition, the pesticide wastewater also contains various primary pollutants including Mn2+, Zn2+, total cyanide, nitrobenzene, and so on. The hazardous consequences of mancozeb include impaired thyroid function, neurotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity, with ETU serving as the endpoint [2]. According to the findings of in vitro research, mancozeb ought to be classified as a reproductive toxicant since it may indirectly interfere with or hinder cellular reproduction [3]. ETU is a typical biotoxic pollutant in organic sulfur pesticide wastewater, which can produce possible carcinogens in an acidic environment [4]. Previous research established that Mn2+ has neurotoxicity to organisms [2]. The growth of the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens would be adversely affected by Zn2+ [5]. These highly toxic pollutants are discharged with the wastewater and cause extremely harsh consequences to the environment. Thus, an available technique of pollution prevention and control is urgently needed to treat organic sulfur pesticide wastewater. ",

The removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), chroma, ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen reached 99 %, 99.8 %, 98.9 % and 46.0 %, respectively. Wang et al. [7] achieved 86.43 % COD removal efficiency and 98.67 % atrazine removal efficiency with permeate COD less than 50 mg/L and NH4+-N less than 1.5 mg/L, respectively, by treating pesticide wastewater through the electro chlorination process. The percentage reduction of dieldrin and deltamethrin in agricultural wastewater following 12 h of UV irradiation at 254 nm and 306 nm wavelengths was 58.8 % and 46.8 %, and 52.9 % and 37.3 %, respectively [8]. However, these methods are costly and could cause secondary pollution which increased the difficulty of subsequent treatment [9]. Moreover, these processes treat wastewater with low concentrations of refractory pollutants or simple wastewater compositions, making them difficult to apply in practical production scenarios. ",

        "text": "Recent pieces of evidence suggested that concentrated wastewater treatment facilities for the pesticide industry started using biochemical techniques to treat pesticide wastewater [10]. Anaerobic biological treatment techniques such as hydrolytic acidification, up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB), anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB), anaerobic internal recirculation reactor (IC) and anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) have potential due to their characteristics of high volumetric loads and high shock-loading resistance for the treatment of pesticide wastewater. The biochemistry of mixed pesticide wastewater containing xylene and abamectin was increased from 0.08 to 0.32 after bipolar acid-base ozone pretreatment and the COD removal efficiency was about 20 % when the influent concentration reached 2150 mg/L in the subsequent anaerobic treatment [11]. Akinapally et al. [12] treated pesticide wastewater with an initial COD of 90000 mg/L using a rotary evaporation-distillation-Fenton-anaerobic digestion process, removing 55 % by anaerobic digestion, for a total removal efficiency of 95 %. Min et al. [13] set up a two-stage anaerobic process with a conventional UASB for treating pesticide wastewater with 67.2 ± 7.9 % average COD removal efficiencies. In addition, AnMBR improves the removal effect while prolonging solid retention time (SRT) and decreasing hydraulic retention time (HRT) [14]. Liu et al. [15] treated diluted pesticide wastewater using AnMBR with maximum COD removal efficiencies of 80.1 %, 80.0 %, 67.4 % and 61.1 % at HRT of 96, 72, 48 and 24 h, respectively. However, far too little attention has been paid to toxic substances with high concentrations such as mancozeb, ETU and Mn2+ in organic sulfur pesticide wastewater, which would inhibit the microorganism activities in the AnMBR, leading to the necessity of diluting the raw pesticide wastewater before it is treated by the conventional AnMBR. Thus, an efficient strategy to reduce the toxicity of pollutants to retrofit AnMBRs for the treatment of organic sulfur pesticide wastewater is critically needed. ",

        "text": "Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are a group of microaerobic or anaerobic Gram-negative microorganisms that are widespread in the oxic-anoxic transition zone of freshwater and marine habitats. Studies have established that the unique property of magnetotaxis of MTB originate from the magnetosome within the microstructure, allowing MTB to sense the north and south pole magnetic fields of the Earth and to be driven by the flagellum [16]. Using this property, MTB can be forced by magnets to move towards the magnetic field, to isolate and enrich from water bodies. One isolation technique called orientation magnetic separation can be used for the separation of motile MTB that contain magnetic moments. This technique utilized a magnetic field to separate bacteria such as Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense strain MSR-1 and Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 from water using an external magnetic field [17]. The separated MTB could then be cultured on a large scale in flasks and fermenters under microaerobic conditions, which provided a basis for the application of MTB in various fields. The applications of MTB have been mainly concentrated in biomedicine, mechanics of materials, crystallography, and astrobiology, with little research in environmental engineering [18,19]. Recently investigators have shown that MTB have significant treatment effects on heavy metals and organic pollutants [17]. MTB could incorporate Mn and Zn into magnetosomes and other cellular compartments, and integrate these metals into the magnetite core of the magnetosomes [20]. In groundwater samples enriched with MTB-enriched solutions, the average removal efficiency of Mn2+ reached 15.26 % [21]. In another study, a consortium of magnetotactic bacteria was utilized to achieve metal recovery rates of 75 % for Zn in diodes and 47 % in resistors, respectively [22]. An additional area of interest is the potential of MTB to effectively remove the prodrugs active ingredient of pesticide. Data from prior studies indicate that genetically modified MTB may serve as a nanobiocatalyst capable of degrading 90–100 % of a 1 mL sample contaminated with 50 μmol/L of ethyl-paraoxon, an organophosphorus pesticide, within a 2-day period [23]. In another study, AMB-1 has been utilized to remove chlorpyrifos from deionized water, river water, tap water, and culture medium, achieving removal efficiencies of 87.5 %, 86.6 %, 73.9 % and 74.7 % within 180 min in dynamic mode [24]. However, the composition of organic sulfur pesticide wastewater is more complex, whether MTB driven by the magnetic field can also maintain a superior removal efficiency of metal ions and prodrug active ingredients remains to be studied. Moreover, previous researches have not investigated combining MTB with anaerobic biological techniques to treat raw pesticide wastewater to investigate its comprehensive treatment efficacy. ",

The specific experimental steps refer to the method of Lopez et al. [28]. For HPLC analysis, a 20 mL extract sample was introduced into a column maintained at a constant temperature of 35 ◦C. The chromatographic column utilized was a Thermo Hypersil ODS2 (250 mm × 50 mm, 5 μm), with a mobile phase consisting of water: acetonitrile (97:3 v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Quantification of mancozeb and ETU was achieved using a diode array detector at wavelengths of 271 nm and 232 nm, respectively. Biogas was collected from the top end of the AnMBR via a hydraulic seal unit and the production was measured by syringes. The methodology for measurement was adapted from Zhao et al. [29]. Methane production was quantified using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD-GC; GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan), which included TDX and Porapak Q chromatographic columns (AETO, China).

Each reactor consisted of an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) of 0.3 m height and 0.05 m inside diameter and a membrane tank with a total working volume of 2.2 L. The influent entered the bottom of the UASB through a PLC-controlled (programmable logic controller) feed pump with constant flow via a flowmeter. Moreover, a three-phase separator at the top of the UASB separated the biogas, wastewater and sludge. Simultaneously, most of the sludge settled back to the bottom of the UASB while a small portion flowed into the membrane tank and was returned by the recirculation pump. The treated wastewater was further filtered through the membrane module and finally pumped into the permeate tank. The membrane module in the membrane tank was a hollow fibre curtain membrane (LS-005, Shanghai Lishui Environmental Protection Equipment Co. Ltd., China), which was made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a 35 mm thickness of membrane fibres, a surface area of 45 cm2 , 2.05 mm outer diameter and 0.1–0.2 μm membrane aperture. In addition, the membrane module was operated by negative pressure suction, and the permeate cycle was: 8 min out and 2 min off. Experimental trials were conducted by operating four stages at HRTs of 60, 48, 36 and 24 h, corresponding to filtration fluxes of 8, 10, 13.1 and 20 L/ m2 ⋅h, respectively. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) was monitored by a vacuum pressure gauge. Water in the permeate tank was used for backwashing. The membranes were backwashed at a frequency of once every 30 min, with each backwash lasting 5 s to control the membrane fouling. Chemical cleaning agents (HCl, Citric acid, NaOH and NaClO) were used to chemically clean the membrane components when TMP was over 50 kPa. ",

When the turntable stopped, the total six magnets were aligned on the same horizontal line with the poles facing the same direction. Afterwards, PLC controlled the turntables to rotate 180◦ every hour and converted the position of the magnet to reverse the magnetic field, which caused the MTB to move directionally to the opposite side. When the turntables were stopped, the magnets stayed at the closest points to the exterior surface of the UASB and the membrane tank. ",

After four or five weeks, the bottles were magnetised by the magnets for 30 min. Subsequently, the magnetically sensitive organisms were collected by Pasteur pipettes. Following that, the organisms were added to the Petri dishes containing the isolation medium (Table S1) in the laminar flow cabinet. Incubated the Petri dishes with magnetic fields in an incubator at 25 ◦C for 2–3 days until single colonies appeared, then picked and isolated them until pure MTB colonies were obtained.

Three sets of parallel experiments were conducted for all assays and the results were averaged thereafter. The assays for protease and α-glucosidase activities were based on Goel et al. [30]. Briefly, protease activity was determined by centrifugation of azo casein after degradation to tyrosine at pH = 8 for 30 min, mixing with 2 M NaOH, and finally measuring the absorbance of the resulting coloured compound at 440 nm. The quantity of enzyme that caused a rise in absorbance of 0.01 at 440 nm was designated as one unit of protease activity (IU). While α-glucosidase degraded p-nitrophenyl-α-Dglucopyranoside into p-nitrophenol at pH = 8 for 30 min, the absorbance was measured at 410 nm after heating in boiling water for 3 min. Thus, IU of α-glucosidase was defined as the amount of mM p-nitrophenol produced in 1 h. Iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT) was used as the reaction substrate, and 37 % formaldehyde was used as the reaction terminator to detect DHA [27]. The reduced product of INT was used for calibration. One enzyme unit (EU) was defined as 1 mM INT-depleted per hour of production. The enzyme activity was biomass divided by the unit of activity, by dividing the IU and EU by the mg MLVSS utilised in the enzyme tests, the specific enzyme activities were computed and expressed as enzyme activity per unit biomass.

After that, following the shock of highconcentration pollutants in stage 2 (influent COD = 18000 mg/L), the COD removal efficiency of R1 dramatically decreased from 73.2 % to 48.7 % and that of R2 decreased from 77.0 % to 65.2 %, respectively (Fig. 2a). At that time, the permeate COD of R was 48.5 % lower than that of R1. To counteract the effects of high pollutant concentrations on the performance of the two reactors, a strategy was implemented. This strategy involved diluting the influent to a reduced concentration and then incrementally restoring it to the original concentration. Two periods, before and after the shock and dilution, were selected to assess the recovery performance of the two reactors under the shock. The influent COD concentrations in 101-113 d (before shock and dilution) and 169- 181 d (after shock and dilution) were 11176 ± 102 mg/L and 11350 ± 198 mg/L, respectively (p > 0.05). In 101-113 d, the permeate COD concentration of R1 was 2372 ± 101 mg/L, which was marginally higher than that of R (2300 ± 45 mg/L), with the difference being not statistically significant (p = 0.41). However, in 169-181 d, the permeate COD concentration of R increased to 2756 ± 68 mg/L, while that of reactor R2 decreased to 1928 ± 167 mg/L, with a pronounced difference observed (p = 0.001). These results suggest that the incorporation of MTB could enhance the load resistance of AnMBR under shock conditions. ",

In stage 1, there were no statistically significant differences in COD removal efficiencies between R1 and R2 (p = 0.14). In stage 2, a significant difference was observed (p = 0.02). In stage 3, an extremely significant difference was noted (p < 0.001). Conversely, in stage 4, there were no statistically significant differences (p = 0.96). The median values of R1 permeate COD concentration were 1444, 2090, 2112 and 2971 mg/L, and those of R2 were 1242, 2064, 1573 and 3060.5 mg/L, respectively (Fig. 2c). In summary, the COD removal efficiencies of R1 and R2 were comparable at HRT of 60 h. R2 demonstrated a higher removal efficiency at HRT of 48 h (prior to the shock of high concentration pollutants). Conversely, after the shock of high concentration pollutants and HRT of 36 h, the removal efficiency of R1 was significantly lower than that of R2. The results obtained suggested that MTB could weaken the negative effect of HRTs decreasing and enhance the load resistance of AnMBR, which could maintain the 65.2 % removal efficiencies under the shock of over 18000 mg/L COD concentration. The reasons could be attributed to that MTB moved along the magnetic field which promoted sludge contact with pollutants and absorption of toxic pollutants, which could advance the activities of microorganisms and the hydrolysis process in the reactor.

The influent mancozeb concentration was greatly high at an average of 4160 ± 712 mg/L. No evident change in permeate concentrations of mancozeb and ETU affected by variations of HRT was observed in the first 280 days (stage 1 to stage 3). On the contrary, when HRT changed to 24 h (stage 4), mancozeb and ETU removal efficiencies of both R1 and R2 decreased significantly, which might result from shorter contact time between pollutant and sludge and higher pollutant loading rate. Specifically, the average concentrations of permeate mancozeb of R1 were over 1000 mg/L, whereas that of R2 reached less than 600 mg/L when HRT decreased from 60 h to 36 h (stage 1 to stage 3). In stage 4 (HRT of 24 h), the average permeate mancozeb of R2 was reduced by 51.6 % compared with R1 which was 2243 mg/L. Additionally, average ETU removal efficiencies of R were 48.82 ± 6.17 %, 27.44 ± 11.32 %, 40.37 ± 4.73 % and 27.73 ± 3.37 % and those of R2 were 73.01 ± 2.54 %, 58.43 ± 7.38 %, 62.12 ± 5.11 % and 35.46 ± 2.59 % for the four stages, respectively. Results indicated that at HRT of 24 h, the ETU removal efficiencies of R1 and R2 are not significantly different compared to those at longer HRTs. It is speculated that this might be due to the ETU produced from the hydrolysis of mancozeb in R not having enough time to undergo further hydrolysis before entering the permeate, while the hydrolysis of ETU in R1 is even slower. This results in high ETU concentrations and low removal efficiencies in the effluent of both R and R2. ",

This phenomenon was attributed to the ETU hydrolysis rate being slower than the rate of mancozeb converting to ETU. Conversely, this phenomenon was not observed in R2 during all operational periods. In conclusion, R2 has a higher refractory pollutants removal efficiency, that of R2 was unable to be accomplished by R1. ",

In contrast, R removed mancozeb incompletely in this study, presumably because organic sulfur pesticide wastewater was more complex and toxic to treat and the concentration of influent mancozeb was humorously higher than in the previous study (> 805 mg/L). However, the results still show that the positive effect of MTB on the degradation of characteristic pollutants was significant in organic sulfur pesticide wastewater by AnMBR. It can be inferred that MTB assisted microorganisms of the reactor in removing more mancozeb and ETU, as well as reducing their toxicity to microorganisms, thereby increasing reactor treatment efficiency.

When the influent Mn2+ concentration was 2631 mg/L at stage 3, the lowest permeate concentration of R2 reached 202 mg/L with 92.33 % removal efficiency (Fig. 4c), and that of R1 was 640 mg/L with 75.69 % removal efficiency, simultaneously (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the lowest Mn2+ removal efficiency of R2 during stage 4 decreased to 60.83 %, and removal efficiency of R1 even decreased to only 43.63 %. The high average influent Mn2+ concentration (3872 ± 691 mg/L) was encountered, resulting in low removal efficiency, especially with the short HRT. Previous research has established that the average removal efficiency of Mn2+ in groundwater could be 15.26 % through enriched MTB solution [21]. Furthermore, bacterial communities are negatively influenced by Mn2+ [33]. These results suggest that MTB may have enhanced the treatment of Mn2+ by directly adsorbing and by promoting the activity of other microorganisms, thereby improving the permeate quality and further enhancing the performance ",

In particular, the best Zn2+ removal efficiency of R2 was 99.03 % and removal efficiency of R1 was 88.60 % at HRT of 36 h. Compared with the average influent Mn2+ concentration, Zn2+ concentration was too low 0.26 ± 0.02 mg/L, thus removal efficiency of Zn2+ was generally higher than that of Mn2+. HRT variation of R2 showed an insignificant impact (p > 0.05) on Zn2+ removal efficiency but that of R1 showed a significant impact (p < 0.05). The above results show that R2 can basically achieve complete removal efficiency of Zn2+ and eliminate heavy metal toxicity enrichment. Within each stage at HRTs of 60, 48 and 36 h, the removal efficiencies of Mn2+ and Zn2+ in R2 gradually increased with the extension of the operational time. This may be since the growth of MTB enhances the remove capacity of heavy metals. The enhanced removal of Mn2+ and Zn2+ by MTB not only further alleviated the heavy metal toxicity in the reactor, but also may have an important impact on enzyme activity [34,35]. ",

The maximum adsorption of R2 occurred at HRT of 48 h, reaching 136 mg/g VSS, which was 21 mg/g VSS higher than the adsorption at HRT of 60 h (Fig. S1b). This suggests that longer HRTs did not necessarily enhance Mn2+ adsorption in this study. The removal efficiencies of Zn2+ did not significantly differ (p > 0.05) between the two reactors under the condition of four HRTs. Furthermore, the adsorption process was characterized using both the Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models (Table S3 and S4). The results indicated that for R2, the adsorption process was well-described by Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models only at HRT of 24 h (R2 = 0.8624 and R2 = 0.8830, respectively), while it could not be described by R1 and at the other three HRTs (R2 < 0.3280 and R2 < 0.3504). This observation might be attributed to the fact that Mn2+ and Zn2+ removal involves more than mere molecular-level adsorption. The increased heterogeneity of organic components and the presence of multiple interactive species may diminish the predictive accuracy of the Langmuir isotherm, particularly in unconventional scenarios where adsorption is not limited to a single molecular layer [36]. Nevertheless, the higher fitting coefficients for R compared to R at equivalent stages suggest that the incorporation of MTB positively influences the adsorption process. ",

The average biogas production of R1 and R2 were 1209.05 ± 658.28 mL/d and 1459.77 ± 808.38 mL/d, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 5b, on 130 d, R2 achieved a maximum biogas production that was 544 mL/d higher than that of R1 (3425 mL/d). This could be due to the high COD in influent, which provided more organic substances for acetoclastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens to digest. Balcıoglu ˘ et al. [38] also discovered the production of biogas rose as the concentration of COD rose from 2500 to 18000 mg/L. However, high-concentration pollutants also contain more toxic substances, which could affect the activities of acetoclastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Consequently, biogas productions of R1 and R2 dropped to 932 and 1467 mL/d on 147d and then gradually recovered to 2322 and 2690 mL/d on 193d, which was similar to the trend of COD removal efficiency (Section 3.1). In addition, biogas productions of R and R were 2053.83 ± 277.47 mL/d and 2604.75 ± 223.91 mL/d, respectively, with an 11000 mg/L influent COD concentration. The biogas production of R2 at this stage was 26.8 % higher than that of R1. Electrical problems and pH decreasing also affected negatively biogas production. Previous studies indicated that HRT had a significant effect on biogas production [39], however, in this study, the main factor affecting biogas production in both reactors appear to be the influent COD concentration. Under the same influent conditions, R2 produced more biogas than R1 because it removed more pollutants that affect the activity of methanogenic microorganisms. ",

SMY, defined as the volume of methane produced per gram of COD removed, is a metric that reflects the efficiency of methane production in both reactors. The SMY of R1 increased from 0.081 L/gCODremoved to 0.228 L/g-CODremoved and that of R2 from 0.080 L/gCODremoved to 0.247 L/g-CODremoved in stage 1 and 2, respectively. The low SMY in stage 1 could be attributed to the methanogenic bacteria not adapting to the wastewater conditions. When HRT was decreased to 24 h (stage 4), the SMY decreased to 0.051 L/g-CODremoved and 0.089 L/gCODremoved. The tendency was similar to the study of Hu et al. [9], where SMY increased from stage 1 to stage 3 and subsequently decreased from stage 3 to stage 4, indicating short HRT affected AnMBR performance negatively. Above all, the SMY averaged over the whole process of R2 was 0.149 ± 0.050 L/g-CODremoved and that of R1 was 0.129 ± 0.045 L/ g-CODremoved. As far as we know, every 1 g of methane production is theoretically necessary to digest 4 g of COD, and the volume of methane was approximately 1.5 L under standard conditions [41]. Therefore, the theoretical SMY was 0.375 L/g-CODremoved, almost impossible to achieve in the experimentation. Compared with other results, Xu et al. [42] utilised an AnMBR with a facultative quorum sensing consortium to achieve the SMY of 0.130 ± 0.050 L/g-CODremoved in the treatment of domestic wastewater. The increase of SMY indicates that the higher methane (biogas) production of R2 was not only due to the digestion of more COD but also because the addition of MTB has enhanced the activity of methanogenic microorganisms.

Two common hydrolytic enzymes found in AnMBR were protease and α-glucosidase, which could improve the hydrolysis of proteins and polysaccharides, respectively [44]. Compared to the R1, the activity of protease in stages 1 to 4 increased by 80.6 ± 12.5 %, 79.8 ± 9.6 %, 105.4 ± 23.6 % and 1.2 ± 0.9 %, respectively. Meanwhile, α-glucosidase activity increased by 30.5 ± 2.6 %, 25.7 ± 2.1 %, 21.3 ± 1.1 % and 5.6 ± 0.7 %, respectively (Fig. 7). When HRT was reduced from 36 to 24 h, there were extremely significant differences in both protease and α-glucosidase activities between stages 3 and 4 (both p < 0.001), whereas no significant differences were observed between stages 1 and 2 (p > 0.05). The results showed that the assistance of MTB significantly improved the hydrolase activity at longer HRTs (HRT of 60, 48 and 36 h), while the enhancement effect was negligible at HRT of 24 h, which was the same as the trend of COD removal efficiency (Fig. 1a). DHA activity affected the process of anaerobic bacteria creating hydrogen through directed fermentation [45]. In addition, the potential to generate acetic acid was indicated by the activity of ACK [46]. Afterwards, methanogenesis requires the coenzyme F420 as a redox cofactor [47]. Over the four stages, the DHA activity of R2 was 239.8 ± 13.3 %, 356.9 ± 34.5 %, 419.6 ± 20.6 % and 318.4 ± 10.8 % relative to R1, respectively. The ACK activity of R2 was ",

This observation implies that although methanogenic enzyme activity associated with methane production of R2 is enhanced compared to R1, this enhancement is not directly proportional to changes in HRT. Previous research suggested that Fe3O4 might enhance hydrolytic enzyme activity, hence promoting AD hydrolysis [48]. Similarly, the MTB also contained magnetosomes consisting mainly of high-purity Fe3O4, which exerted a positive effect on the hydrolytic enzymes. Furthermore, excessive heavy metal, mancozeb and ETU concentrations may be detrimental to hydrolysis processes, but the assistance of MTB reduces the toxic effects of pollutants, making enzyme activities of R2 increase compared with R1.

As shown in Fig. 9a-b, the protease and α-glucosidase activities decreased as the mancozeb concentration increased, indicating that mancozeb significantly inhibited the hydrolase activity and further reduced the COD removal efficiency. The DHA activity of R2 decreased rapidly with the increase of mancozeb concentration, which indicated that low concentrations of mancozeb could inhibit DHA activity and further affect methane yield (Fig. 9c). Similarly, increased concentrations of ETU also significantly inhibited the activities of protease and DHA (Fig. 9d-e). Paradoxically, coenzyme F420 activity was positively correlated with ETU (Fig. 9f). However, when viewed in conjunction with the two reactors, the relatively low ETU concentration of R would not yet have had a substantial effect on coenzyme F420 activity. In contrast, the ETU concentration of R1 was over 1000 and 600 mg/L, respectively, resulting in a coenzyme F420 activity that was consistently no higher than 600 nmol/g VS. Conversely, under the same stress conditions, the activity of coenzyme F420 in R2 could exceed 800 nmol/g VS, indicating that the addition of MTB mitigated the toxicity of ETU. Although mancozeb and ETU have a little effect on DHA, the most important factor is Mn2+ concentration. DHA activity of R1 decreased from 0.245 EU/g to 0.122 EU/g in the increase of Mn2+ concentration from 300 mg/L to 1409 mg/L (Fig. 9g).

Thus, the first step is the hydrolysis of organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides into amino acids and monosaccharides through the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes by microorganisms. Therefore, the COD removal efficiency may be influenced by the activity of hydrolytic enzymes. The polynomial fitting models of protease and α-glucosidase with COD removal efficiency are illustrated in Fig. 10. The concentration of protease is linearly correlated with the COD removal efficiency in the first order. As shown in Fig. 10a, R2 up to R2 = 0.9972 and those of R1 also showed a strong correlation (R2 = 0.9590). This suggested that an increase in protease activity can significantly promote COD removal efficiency. Combined with Sections 3.1 and 3.6, it was reasonable to speculate that MTB promoted the hydrolysis of protein in anaerobic biological treatment by increasing protease activity, which in turn increased COD removal efficiency.

A similar situation was observed in R2, where the removal efficiency was 75.9 % when the activity was 0.35 IU/g, while when the activity was 0.47 IU/g, the removal efficiency decreased to 73.7 %. This indicated that a further increase in α-glucosidase activity of reactors would not improve COD removal efficiency when the activity reached the critical value between 0.29 and 0.33 IU/g. This could also explain why the α-glucosidase properties of R2 in Section 3.6 showed a small enhancement (21.3–30.5 %) compared to R1.

As displayed in Fig. 10d, ACK activity showed a similar relationship with biogas production, with a much stronger fit of R2 (R2 = 0.7082) than that of R1 (R2 = 0.0458). ACK directly characterizes the performance of the reactor to produce acetic acid which is an important precursor used by acetoclastic methanogens for methanogenesis. The lower fit of R1 would be due to the reactor methanogenic bacteria thoroughly not utilising acetic acid for methane production, resulting in lower SMY and biogas production. On the other hand, the higher fitting performance indicated that the ACK activity had become the limiting factor for the methanogenesis of R2. The amount of methane (biogas) production is dependent on the amount of acetic acid production. Therefore, the high ACK activity of R2 improved the methanogenic capacity.

Coenzyme F420 is usually regarded as an important indicator for characterizing methanogenic activity in anaerobic processes [49]. The activity of coenzyme F420 were increased by the assistance of MTB and further improved biogas production and SMA. Notably, DHA was another enzyme associated with SMA. Nevertheless, DHA activity became negatively correlated with SMA to a higher degree in R1 (R2 = 0.7196), while the two could be considered unrelated in R2 (R2 = 0.0323) (Fig. 10g-h). The dehydrogenase activity in the AnMBR represents anaerobic bacteria that produce hydrogen through directed fermentation [45], the anaerobic bacteria which produce hydrogen could lead to substrate competition with acetoclastic methanogens, thus decreasing the SMA of R1. In contrast, the average SMA of R2 was 11.7 % higher than that of R1. Among the five enzymes in both reactors, only ACK in R1 showed a weak correlation with methane content, with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.6096. This again verified that acetic acid in R1 was not fully utilised and the methanogenic performance in biogas was still not optimal, whereas the addition of MTB might alter the distribution and abundance of microbial communities within the reactor, which further increased the methanogenesis-related enzyme activities and finally improved the methanogenic capacity.

        "text": "The above results showed that mancozeb and ETU in organic sulfur pesticide wastewater had significant inhibitory effects on hydrolases, and had a certain impact on enzymes related to the methanogenesis process. On the other hand, Mn2+ and Zn2+ inhibited the activity of DHA and ACK, respectively, and further influenced methane yield by reducing the substrate acetic acid required by acetoclastic methanogens and the activity of hydrogen-producing microorganisms [47,50]. As mentioned before, MTB could assist in removing mancozeb and ETU to weaken their toxicity. At the same time, the directional movement of MTB under the magnet field could promote the contact of pollutants with the bottom sludge to increase the enzyme activity, and further improve the COD removal efficiency and methane yield. In addition, MTB had strong adsorption on Mn2+ and Zn2+, which reduced the high osmotic pressure due to high Mn2+ concentration and the inhibition of Zn2+ on biogas production. Although c-AnMBR also had high removal efficiency of Mn2+ and Zn2+ due to microorganisms stimulated by toxic pollutants and heavy metals to produce extracellular polymers (EPS) and soluble microbial products (SMP), which could complex with metal ions and protect microorganisms from toxicity [27]. However, excessively high EPS reduces the exposure of microorganisms to contaminants and could cause serious membrane fouling. In contrast, MTB mitigated the toxic effects on microorganisms of the AnMBR by removing mancozeb, ETU, Mn2+ and Zn2+ from the influent, resulting in less secretion of EPS and SMP by microorganisms. Additionally, the applied magnetic field has been shown to attenuate the formation of EPS and SMP in MBR [51]. In summary, the process by which MTB enhances the AnMBR can be outlined as follows: The combined effect of MTB and the enhanced magnetic field reduced the toxic pollutants in the organic sulfur pesticide wastewater, decreased the interference of refractory pollutants such as mancozeb and ETU, and heavy metals like Mn2+ and Zn2+ on microorganisms. This leads to an increase in the activity of hydrolytic enzymes and methanogenesis-related enzymes, thereby further improving the COD removal efficiency and methane production capability. ",

Quantitative analyses revealed that R2 outperformed R1, achieving significantly higher removal efficiencies for mancozeb (20.92 %), ETU (26.81 %), Mn2+ (17.64 %), and Zn2+ (10.43 %). Concurrently, R2 exhibited enhanced enzymatic activities: protease (205.4 %), α-glucosidase (130.5 %), dehydrogenase (419.6 %), acetate kinase (169.6 %), and coenzyme F420 (128.8 %), with statistically distinct performance across operational stages (p < 0.05). These improvements correlated with elevated biogas production (3969 mL/d) and methane content (68.39 ± 3.41 %), yielding a 15.5 % higher specific methane yield and 13.2 % greater specific methane activity than R1. Strong interdependencies (R2 > 0.7529) were observed among refractory pollutant degradation, enzymatic activity, COD removal efficiencies, and methane productivity, suggesting that MTB alleviated heavy metal inhibition, thereby improving the efficiencies of AnMBR in treating pollutants. Future research should prioritize in situ magnetosome-mediated mechanisms, analysis of the microbial communities, influencing factors of membrane fouling and techno-economic optimization for scaling MTB-assisted anaerobic systems.
